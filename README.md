# Mask_Pattern
full-face mask pattern designed in AutoCAD 2021

Materials Needed:
路	~3/4 yard Lightweight, breathable fabric
路	Velcro or button for neck closure
路	6 to 8 inches of 1/8" elastic for ear loops (can also use hair elastics)
路	pipe cleaner or other wire tie for nose bridge

Note:
This mask is not intended for use in medical settings. This design does not contain a filter pocket. This was designed by a civil engineer who wanted a comfortable mask. 

Instructions:

PRINT & CUT PATTERN
1.	Print this pattern at a 1":1" scale. 
1.1.	If printing to 8.5"x11" paper, print all three (3) pages.
1.2.	Cut out pieces and tape together to form the complete pattern.

PIN & CUT FABRIC

2.	Pin pattern along fold of fabric as indicated. 
3.	Transfer dart markings and nose pocket locations onto fabric.
4.	Cut two (2) pieces. 

STITCH MASK

5.	Stitch darts on both pieces of fabric. 
6.	Trim excess fabric at darts.
7.	Pin right-sides together with ear elastics in place (tuck inside).
8.	Sew mask along seam allowance. 
8.1.	Leave the right closure location open.
8.2.	Do not go all the way around yet!
9.	Turn mask right-side out by pulling it through the open end.

FORM THE NOSE WIRE POCKET

10.	Start  at the left edge of the mask.
11.	Stitch 2 sides of the nose pocket by top stitching. 
12.	Fold nose wire to fit the pocket, if needed.
13.	Place nose wire by inserting it through the open end (this is the tricky part, sorry). 
14.	Close nose wire pocket by stitching the final edge.

ADD CLOSURE OF YOUR CHOICE

Test fit the mask, if possible. Adjust the closure placement to fit the intended wearer as needed.

Using Velcro:

You will need about 1/2" x 1/2" patch of Velcro (any hook and loop product works).
a.	Separate sides of Velcro. 
b.	Working on the open end of the mask, fold over 1/4" to the inside twice (hiding the raw edge). 
c.	Pin one side of the Velcro over the fold made in the previous step. This will be on the inside of the mask.
d.	Sew through the Velcro and all fabric layers. Sew inside perimeter of  Velcro and then across its area in an X pattern to secure.
e.	On the opposite closure end, fold end to the inside once.
f.	Pin the other side of Velcro to right side of mask, incorporating fold from previous step.
d.	Sew through the Velcro and all fabric layers. Sew inside perimeter of  Velcro and then across its area in an X pattern to secure.

Using a button:

a.	Working on the open end of the mask, fold over 1/4" to the inside twice (hiding the raw edge). 
b.	Create buttonhole through all layers of fabric. Follow your sewing machine's instructions or manually stitch a buttonhole to prevent fraying and secure fabric.
c.	On the opposite closure end, fold end to the inside once. 
d.	Topstitch across closure end.
e.	On the outside of the mask, sew the button into place. 

ENJOY!
